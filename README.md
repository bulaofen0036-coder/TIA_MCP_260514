# TIA Portal MCP Server (V20 + V21 · S7DCL · CLI · read-only online monitoring · one-click config · Doctor)

> Current version: see the Release badge below and [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) (this README no longer hardcodes a version).

**English** · [中文](README.zh-CN.md)

> **v2.0 — the same exe is also a declarative CLI (`tia`).** Any AI emits a
> YAML/JSON spec, any engineer runs one command (`tia gen spec.yaml`) — no MCP
> client required. Verbs: `gen` / `patch` / `compile` / `describe` / `export` /
> `import` / `prewarm` / `schema` / `version`. Exit code 0/1/2. See
> `docs/CLI_quickstart.md`. The MCP server behaviour is unchanged.

Drive **Siemens TIA Portal V20 or V21** from any **MCP** client (stdio or HTTP):
create projects, add hardware, generate PLC objects (Tag / UDT / DB / SCL / LAD),
build **WinCC Unified** screens and events, compile-and-diagnose, and save —
all through natural-language tool calls. The bundle ships **prebuilt runtimes**,
a Skill spec, a static tool list, a capability matrix, PLC/HMI templates,
one-shot project blueprints, and a manual. **No separate source clone required**
to run.

> Works with any MCP-capable client — Cursor, VS Code, Claude Desktop, or your
> own HTTP client — using the same `TiaMcpServer.exe`.

## 🆕 v2.5.0 — put a TIA Portal project under Git (Version Control Interface)

TIA Portal projects are binary, so Git cannot diff them — which is why "version
control" in this field has long meant a pile of dated *Save As* folders.
The V21 **Version Control Interface** maps a project onto an ordinary folder,
**one text file per block**, so it can be diffed, committed and reviewed.
This release wraps the whole round-trip into a few commands — **you never have to
click anything inside the TIA Portal UI**.

One sentence to your AI client is enough:

```
Put the current project under Git, use D:\repos\my-plc as the workspace
```

It creates the workspace → **maps the whole project automatically** (hundreds of
blocks in one command, no manual ticking) → exports the text, and you `git commit`.
Later, to see what changed:

```
GetVersionControlStatus(changedOnly=true)
→ A3_4_Hoist | Unequal        ← per block, not per file
```

- **Covered**: FC / FB / OB / DB, PLC tag tables, UDTs — the whole software side.
  Hardware configuration and know-how-protected blocks are **not** covered by the
  VCI; the tool reports them explicitly instead of skipping them silently.
- A block **must compile before it can be exported** (a TIA limitation); change
  *detection* is unaffected and works even on unsaved edits.
- Companion `tools/vci-watch/`: after each successful compile it auto-exports,
  writes the CHANGELOG and runs `git commit` — the engineer does nothing.

## ⚡ Fastest start (3 steps, no coding — CLI path)

> First time? **No MCP client, no code.** Once TIA is installed, these 3 steps
> generate your first project in minutes.
> (Wiring an AI client like Cursor / Claude Desktop over MCP instead? See
> [Quick Start](#quick-start) below.)

1. **Prepare**: install **TIA Portal V20 or V21** + **.NET Framework 4.8**; add your
   Windows user to the local **`Siemens TIA Openness`** group and **log off/on once**
   (the group is not effective until re-login — the single most common blocker).
   **Use the exe matching your installed version** — the bundle root ships
   `tia.cmd` (V21) / `tia-v20.cmd` (V20); all other paths are auto-resolved.
   - **Health-check first**: run `tia.cmd doctor` (V20: `tia-v20.cmd doctor`) once after
     install — it checks TIA install / exe-version match / Openness group / host
     registration and prints the exact fix per problem (`--fix` auto-adds the group).
2. **Prewarm (optional, recommended)**: double-click `scripts\预热.bat` and leave the
   window open. It keeps one headless TIA resident so every later command connects in
   **~1s** (without it, each run cold-starts ~3 min). Press `Ctrl+C` to close.
3. **Generate a project**: drag a ready-made template
   `templates\project-blueprints\scaffold_spec_motor.json` (or
   `scaffold_spec_start_stop.json`) **onto `scripts\生成工程.bat`** — it creates the
   project → adds PLC/HMI → builds blocks → compiles → saves in one shot. Exit code
   `0` means success.
   - To customize: have any AI emit a spec per [`docs/AI_spec_prompt.md`](docs/AI_spec_prompt.md)
     (YAML or JSON), then drag it onto `生成工程.bat`.
   - CLI equivalent: add the bundle root to PATH, then `tia gen <spec>` (start with
     `--dry-run` for an offline check).

## Highlights

- **Stability-first public generation (v0.0.39).** `PlcBuildAndImport` now returns
  `CapabilityDecision`, `CapabilityWarnings`, and `RecommendedNextActions`;
  `ApplyUnifiedHmiScreenDesignJson(strict=true)` fails when any HMI property write
  fails; `EnsureUnifiedHmiTag(requireVerifiedBinding=true)` requires readback as
  `SymbolicVerified` or `AbsoluteVerified`.
- **Dual-version support (V20 + V21).** Two separate executables, not
  interchangeable: V21 binds the split DLLs (`Siemens.Engineering.Base/Step7/…`),
  V20 binds the monolithic `Siemens.Engineering.dll`.
  - V21 → `tools/tiaportal-mcp/src/TiaMcpServer/bin/Release/net48/TiaMcpServer.exe`
  - V20 → `tools/tiaportal-mcp/src/TiaMcpServer/bin-v20/Release/net48/TiaMcpServer.exe`
- **Version-safe imports.** Generated Openness XML is normalized to the connected
  portal version on import, so a V20 portal no longer rejects blocks with
  *"engineering version 'V21' is not supported"*.
- **S7DCL textual format.** `ExportAsDocuments` / `ExportBlocksAsDocuments` /
  `ImportFromDocuments` / `ImportBlocksFromDocuments` read/write the diff-friendly
  SIMATIC SD text format (`.s7dcl` + `.s7res`) on V20+ and are flagged *PREFERRED on
  V21+*. The SimaticML XML chain remains for backward compatibility.
- **183 tools** across project, hardware, PLC, HMI, and online operations,
  layered `[L0]`/`[L1]`/`[L2]` so a normal session only needs L0 + L1.

## Requirements

- Windows + **.NET Framework 4.8**
- **TIA Portal V20 or V21** installed
- Current user added to the **`Siemens TIA Openness`** local group (re-login after)

## Quick Start

1. **Locate the portal install root** (one of):
   - pass `--tia-portal-location "D:\app\TIA20\Portal V20"` when launching (recommended for non-default installs);
   - set the `TiaPortalLocation` user environment variable;
   - let it auto-read `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Siemens\Automation\_InstalledSW\TIAP{20|21}\TIA_Opns\Path`.
   With multiple versions installed, pass `--tia-major-version 20` (or `21`) explicitly.
2. **Mount the MCP — one command, fully automatic.**
   Double-click `配置MCP.bat` in the bundle root (V20: `配置MCP-v20.bat`), or run `tia.cmd config`.

   > Engine exe locations by distribution: Release zip →
   > `tools\tiaportal-mcp\src\TiaMcpServer\bin\Release\net48\` (V21) /
   > `...\bin-v20\Release\net48\` (V20); git clone → `runtime\v21\`
   > (V20 runtime is not shipped in git — download the Release zip).
   > All launcher scripts resolve both layouts automatically.

   It self-discovers everything: its own absolute path, the installed TIA Portal
   (registry) and version, and the version-matching exe (V20/V21 picked for you) —
   then writes the `tia-portal` entry into every AI host detected on this machine:
   **Claude Desktop / Claude Code / Cursor / VS Code** (existing config backed up
   as `.bak`, other servers preserved). Restart the AI client to load it.
   Options: `config --host vscode` (or `claude|claude-code|cursor`), `config --print`
   to copy a snippet manually. The server lists **~55 core tools of 222 by default**
   (~8,500 instead of ~38,800 tokens of schema per turn) so weaker models are not drowned
   and VS Code/Copilot's 128-tool cap and Windsurf's 100 never trip. Nothing is lost: the
   model reaches every other tool on demand with `FindTools("plain words")` +
   `CallTool(name, argumentsJson)`, and the handshake instructions tell it so. Pass
   `config --full` to list the whole tool surface instead.
   If anything fails to connect, run `tia.cmd doctor` (v2.2.8): a one-shot environment
   check (TIA install, exe/version match, Openness group, host registration) with the
   exact fix per problem; `--fix` auto-adds the Openness group. Since v2.2.7 the exe also **self-routes**: if it was
   built for a different TIA major version than the machine has, it transparently
   re-execs the matching sibling exe — grabbing the "wrong" exe no longer crashes.
   Manual fallback: copy the snippet from `cursor-mcp.example.json`, replace
   `REPLACE_ME` with this bundle's root, pick the exe path by TIA version; for
   non-default installs add `"--tia-portal-location","<root>","--tia-major-version","<20|21>"` to `args`.
3. **First call sequence:** `Bootstrap` → `Connect` → `OpenProject` (or
   `CreateProject`) → `GetProjectTree`, then read the real `PLC_*` / `HMI_RT_*`
   paths from the tree before continuing.

### Offline validation (no TIA needed)

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\Validate-Bundle.ps1
```

Checks runtime presence, blueprint file completeness, tool-count consistency, and
that PLC/HMI JSON parse. Add `-Strict` for tighter manifest/matrix comparison.

## Build from source

The full source lives under `tools/tiaportal-mcp/src/TiaMcpServer` (51 `.cs`).

```powershell
# V21 (split DLLs)
dotnet build tools/tiaportal-mcp/src/TiaMcpServer/TiaMcpServer.csproj -c Release
# V20 (monolithic DLL) — clean intermediates first if you just built the other target
dotnet build tools/tiaportal-mcp/src/TiaMcpServer/TiaMcpServer.V20.csproj -c Release
```

## Capabilities & boundaries

**Can do:** projects & hardware, PROFINET, declarative PLC import, LAD XML import,
WinCC Unified connections / tags (absolute addressing) / screens / button
Down·Up / dynamization, compile-and-diagnose, save.

**Not bundled:** Siemens install media, field projects, business-specific
technology. `reference/` is style/instruction reference only. See `notBundled` in
`manifest/package-manifest.json`. For what Openness **cannot** do, see
`手册/openness-limitations.md`.

## Version branches & contributing

`master` is always the stable line for **TIA Portal V20 / V21**; its default
behaviour never changes to accommodate older releases. Earlier TIA Portal /
Openness versions live on their own branches, and contributions there are welcome:

| Branch | Target version | Maintenance |
|--------|----------------|-------------|
| `master` | TIA Portal V20 / V21 | Official main line (day-to-day work lands here) |
| `v21` | TIA Portal V21 / Openness V21 | Official; forked from master, V21-only adaptations |
| `v20` | TIA Portal V20 / Openness V20 | Official; forked from master, V20-only adaptations |
| `v19` | TIA Portal V19 / Openness V19 | Community |
| `v18` | TIA Portal V18 / Openness V18 | Community |
| `v17` | TIA Portal V17 / Openness V17 | Community |
| `v16` | TIA Portal V16 / Openness V16 | Community |

**How to contribute**

- Send a fix or adaptation for an older release to **its own branch** (a V17 change
  goes to `v17`), not to `master`.
- `v21` / `v20` are official lines: **anything that applies to both versions still
  goes to `master`.** Only use a version branch when a fix would change the other
  version's behaviour or depends on an API that exists in one version only — that
  way shared code stays in one place.
- Older Openness APIs and block XML differ substantially, so branching lets each
  version be validated independently without destabilising main-line users.
- If a fix turns out to be general and stable, a small follow-up PR back to
  `master` is very welcome.
- Please **do not commit**: TIA project files (`.apXX`), `bin` / `obj`, logs,
  screenshots, backups, machine-specific absolute paths, or scratch test projects.
